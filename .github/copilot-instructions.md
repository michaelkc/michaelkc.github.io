# Copilot instructions — michaelkc.github.io

Purpose
- Help an AI agent be productive quickly in this GitHub Pages (Jekyll) repo that hosts michaelkc.github.io.

Big picture
- Static site / blog (GitHub Pages). Content lives under _posts and other Jekyll dirs. Prompts and agent conventions live in .github/prompts.

Where to look for more context
- .github/prompts/*.prompt.md for agent-specific rules and frontmatter (models, agents).
- _posts/ for examples of style and formatting used in monthly rolling posts.
