This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing specifically included files, combined into a single document by Repomix.

# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Only files matching these patterns are included: Gemfile.lock, *.markdown, *.md, _config.yml, _posts/2020-05-24-open-windows-terminal-in-current-directory.markdown, _posts/2024-12-03-interesting-stuff-i-found.markdown
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

As a long time [Total Commander](https://www.ghisler.com/) user, I rely heavily on opening cmd.exe/powershell.exe/pwsh.exe/bash in the currently selected directory. So I was a bit annoyed when i found out that the new Windows Terminal, wt.exe, by default opens in your home directory.

It turns out to be a [regression](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/620#issuecomment-535228867). For now, the workaround is to add 

`"startingDirectory": null`

to the default profile in settings.json (Windows Terminal -> dropdown -> Settings), e.g.

{% highlight json %} 
{
	// Make changes here to the powershell.exe profile
	"startingDirectory": null,
	"guid": "{61c54bbd-c2c6-5271-96e7-009a87ff44bf}",
	(...)
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/michaelkc/michaelkc.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/michaelkc/michaelkc.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Low-budget migration from .NET Startup-based hosting to minimal hosting
Minimal hosting is a requirement for onboarding Aspire, and I needed to convert a project where the integration test infrastructure relies heavily on Startup.

I had to adjust the code a bit, but the approach outlined here made the job a lot easier than a huge refactoring

[https://www.strathweb.com/2022/02/using-an-existing-startup-class-with-asp-net-6-minimal-hosting-model/](https://www.strathweb.com/2022/02/using-an-existing-startup-class-with-asp-net-6-minimal-hosting-model/)

### Viewing "roundtripped" C# code (C# -> IL -> C#)
Saw this used in a presentation

[https://sharplab.io/](https://sharplab.io/)

### Secret OPerationS & ZAP
I have been eyeing [SOPS](https://getsops.io/) for a while, and I got around to actually using it, as I needed to encrypt the contents of some YAML configuration files for [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) Automation Framework.

It turns out to be really easy to use when you have a Key Management service available, we are using Azure Key Vault and it works flawlessly. Recommended.

### SWEBOOK - An Evolving Body of Knowledge
A massive tome (400+ pages) attempting to cover software engineering. I did not read much of it, but judging from the ToC it seems comprehensive.

### Cloudypad - gaming on spot instances
Someone whipped together a script to provision and configure a AWS/Amazon spot VM with NVIDIA T4000 and steam games via Moonlight. That is an interesting concept, but with the cost estimates they provide something like Xbox Ultimate seems like a better deal.
