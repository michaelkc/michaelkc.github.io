### Hosting HTTP(s) enabled endpoints during .NET testing
[Hanselman identified a hackish way to do it for .NET 8](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/updating-to-net-8-updating-to-ihostbuilder-and-running-playwright-tests-within-nunit-headless-or-headed-on-any-os), 
and there is [official support coming in .NET 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHUwqsRtPCU).

I might just hold off until .NET 10, but it will be nice, as it will allow less brittle integration tests of Blazor UIs, something that work very poorly against live environments atm.
