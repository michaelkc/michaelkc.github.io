### MicroK8s, k3s and minikube
Small scale, opinionated and supposedly much easier to get running than Kubernetes used to be, this is something I am considering dedicating some time to. 

For production work, App Service and more PaaS-y services like Container Apps still seems preferable to running Kubernetes proper.

### Squooosh
Got reminded of this one today. Easy way to optimize and/or analyze impact of optimizing images, e.g. to optimized WebP with reduced palette

### Fermyon Spin - WebAssembly FaaS
Attended a workshop on this last year, interesting to track how it evolves

### .http files in Rider
Like old-school Postman, with env/secret/oauth support. But sucks that you need Rider or IntelliJ Ultimate to run them. Visual Studio has some support, but seems to be missing the authn stuff at least. I will probably stick to Postman and/or Bruno for now.

### How developers spend their time
Via Adam Thornhill / CodeScene "The Code Quality Advantage"

Developers spend only 5% of time writing code, so until LLMs can maintain huge codebases, optimizing for generation is optimizing 5% of time spent.
