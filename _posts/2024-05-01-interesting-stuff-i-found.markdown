### MicroK8s, k3s and minikube
Small scale, opinionated and supposedly much easier to get running than Kubernetes used to be, this is something I am considering dedicating some time to. 

For production work, App Service and more PaaS-y services like Container Apps still seems preferable to running Kubernetes proper.

### Squooosh
Got reminded of this one today. Easy way to optimize and/or analyze impact of optimizing images, e.g. to optimized WebP with reduced palette

### Fermyon Spin - WebAssembly FaaS
Attended a workshop on this last year, interesting to track how it evolves

### .http files in Rider
Like old-school Postman, with env/secret/oauth support. But sucks that you need Rider or IntelliJ Ultimate to run them. Visual Studio has some support, but seems to be missing the authn stuff at least. I will probably stick to Postman and/or Bruno for now.

Edit 28/5 [https://www.leeholmes.com/security-risks-of-postman/](https://www.leeholmes.com/security-risks-of-postman/) - true, it is incredibly difficult to navigate Postman config values to avoid them being cloud synced.

### How developers spend their time
Via Adam Thornhill / CodeScene "The Code Quality Advantage"

Developers spend only 5% of time writing code, so until LLMs can maintain huge codebases, optimizing for generation is optimizing 5% of time spent.

### Third party cookie phaseout rolling out in Chrome
After going back and forth a number of times, Google is finally rolling it out, initially to 1% of users.
This is going to produce a lot of "interesting" error reports on legacy software...

### Maester - Pester tests to compare an Entra tenant to best practice setup
Useful if you are responsible for the security of an Entra tenant

### Local coding assistant
Use Llama3 as a GitHub CoPilot-like coding assistant in VSCode with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (available on winget) and [Continue](https://docs.continue.dev/intro)

### NetArchTest to enforce structural constraints
I have been using [NetArchTest](https://github.com/BenMorris/NetArchTest) in combination with Feature Folders with great success for a while. Recommended.

### On matching problem at hand with the right technology
I love this line of thinking. So often I encounter the solution (e.g. shiny new tech) looking for a problem to solve, but you should absolutely reach for complex tech (like lower-level Kubernetes) when it is warranted by the requirements.

[You can’t assess whether Kubernetes is a poor choice because of “high operational burden” without understanding the problem we are solving.](https://x.com/samgoodwin89/status/1784414025323049235)

### Scaling history at Uber
When people want to go microservices from day 1 for imaginary scaling concerns, it is nice to be able to remind them that Uber started life as a LAMP stack monolith
