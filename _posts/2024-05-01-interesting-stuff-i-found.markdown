### MicroK8s, k3s and minikube
Small scale, opinionated and supposedly much easier to get running than Kubernetes used to be, this is something I am considering dedicating some time to. 

For production work, App Service and more PaaS-y services like Container Apps still seems preferable to running Kubernetes proper.

### Squooosh
Got reminded of this one today. Easy way to optimize and/or analyze impact of optimizing images, e.g. to optimized WebP with reduced palette
