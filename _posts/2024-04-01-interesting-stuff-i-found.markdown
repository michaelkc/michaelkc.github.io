### .NET Smart Components
LLMs gets embedded everywhere, interesting to see how this one plays out. Still unsupported preview though.

### Observability Cost Crisis and Observability 2.0
As OpenTelemetry gains traction, these are good points from Charity Majors. We are defintely feeling the pains described with our current stacks (which are more like observability 0.5).

The concept of canonical log lines makes sense - not much experience yet, but I suppose there is a way to enrich the OpenTelemetry traces to achieve this?

### SchemaSpy and  SQLite Schema Diagram
Auto-generating documentation with SchemaSpy would be nice to supplement developer docs. Might go well with an Internal Developer Platform like backstage.

For lightweight "what is in this SQLite DB" (where I usually use Linqpad), this looks useful
