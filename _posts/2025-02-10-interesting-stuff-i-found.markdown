### Using Nix with GitHub Actions
Nix is great for ensuring reproducable environments, I am going to trial this approach for a few GH Actions workflows I have for
working with automated testing of DbUp-revisioned schemas on live data.

For run-of-the-mill builds, NUKE + GitHub Actions works very well, so not much need there.

### HTMX for ASP.NET Core Developers
At work we mostly use Blazor, but it is not without issues. I would like to trial HTMX with Razor Pages/Static Blazor, 
it looks like a solid alternative (in the vein of Rails Turbo/Stimulus) in between old-school server-side web and Blazor.
