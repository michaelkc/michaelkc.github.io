### Using Nix with GitHub Actions
Nix is great for ensuring reproducable environments, I am going to trial this approach for a few GH Actions workflows I have for
working with automated testing of DbUp-revisioned schemas on live data.

For run-of-the-mill builds, NUKE + GitHub Actions works very well, so not much need there.

### HTMX for ASP.NET Core Developers
At work we mostly use Blazor, but it is not without issues. I would like to trial HTMX with Razor Pages/Static Blazor, 
it looks like a solid alternative (in the vein of Rails Turbo/Stimulus) in between old-school server-side web and Blazor.

### Build your own voice assistant and run it locally
Whisper, Ollama and Bark, then stitch it together for a voice assitant with LLM "intelligence". My Python-foo is not strong, but it would be fun to use C# to recreate this.

### An actual useful Blockchain case
Beyond Bitcoin (which I consider mostly evil, being an enabler/driver of corruption, terrorism, cyber crime and green house emissions), I had yet to see a use case for Blockchain, and the hype has mostly died down with the new LLM craze (some time before actually). But the other day at an event, I ran into an employee from [Partisia](https://www.partisia.com/about/), who described their actual useful software, which relies on Blockchain to reach consensus between multiple parties with no peer-to-peer trust. Interesting.
