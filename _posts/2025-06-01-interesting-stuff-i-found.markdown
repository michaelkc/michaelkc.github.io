### LegoGPT
Create (simple) lego structures based on text instructions. I was not terribly impressed with the results when I tried it, but hey, it's lego!

### OneNote Markdown Exporter
This can export OneNote notes to folders in markdown or in the 
[import format](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/onenote-importer/37720/6) of [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). 
I am considering alternatives for note taking/archiving/search, this will come in handy to be able to work with my actual data, 
as well being a more vendor neutral back up format than what I currently have.

### Semantic Kernel
I finally got around to actually builing a small demo with Semantic Kernel. The tool integration is very smooth, but I had trouble getting it to work
with locally-running ollama and phi4-mini. While the latter claimed tool support, it simply did not call them, no matter how i prompted.
Using an Azure AI foundry deployment of GPT-4 worked flawlessly though. I can see this being super powerful, but currently have no real-world case where I can
apply it.

### (A) LLM CodeGen Workflow
I have tried various approaches to throwing problems at multi-edit LLM tools like Cursor and GitHub CoPilot Edits, but have had limited success. Some of the issues
seem to be related to my tech stack (Blazor, .NET, bleeding edge), but I suspect part of the problem has also been "chunking" the problem space into something the 
LLM can handle.

Some people recommend going in very small steps, like manual TDD. But I found this description of a process with distinct ideation, planning and 
todo->execution phases interesting, and will try that out soon.
