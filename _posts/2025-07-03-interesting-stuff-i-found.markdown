### Azure Icons
Deep down in a Onenote note I found an old link to a [third-party maintained collection of Azure icons](https://github.com/benc-uk/icon-collection) (for presentations and documentation) 

That has not been updated in a while, but it turns out there is now an official Microsoft collection of Azure icons.

### What if we could eliminate accounts
I love when people challenge common wisdom. Not sure the suggestions are practical right now, but as someone who is working with CIAM day-to-day, I know that what we do today is not great. 
Maybe it could be a way forward with some industry support, but for now, I try to passwordless all the tings and stick with the accounts, warts and all.

### American politics
The current politics of the US seem extreme - and it is nice to hear significant voices in tech [call it out](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shanselman_its-so-frustrating-that-there-is-this-illusion-activity-7346720944465334272-a0cR)

Instead of gutting health care to ~balance the budget~ deliver tax cuts to the rich, maybe they should make the [ultra rich contribute proportionally instead](https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2025/06/a-minimum-tax-on-billionaires.html)?

### Entra Sign-in URL Builder
Useful for testing entra apps, and for browsing Graph scopes

### Google NotebookLM & OneNote Copilot Notebooks
In the note-taking part of my info pipeline, [NotebookLM keeps popping up](https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-changed-view-of-ai/). It has the ability to take a number of documents (markdown, PDF - up to 50 for free) then allow you to chat about it and generate an audio overview.
I plan to try it out for my upcoming Azure certification.

Currently, I use OneNote for note taking, so I am also looking forward to trying out what looks like a copycat feature, Copilot Notebooks
