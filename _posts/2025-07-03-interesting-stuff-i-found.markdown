### Azure Icons
Deep down in a Onenote note I found an old link to a [third-party maintained collection of Azure icons](https://github.com/benc-uk/icon-collection) (for presentations and documentation) 

That has not been updated in a while, but it turns out there is now an official Microsoft collection of Azure icons.

### What if we could eliminate accounts
I love when people challenge common wisdom. Not sure the suggestions are practical right now, but as someone who is working with CIAM day-to-day, I know that what we do today is not great. 
Maybe it could be a way forward with some industry support, but for now, I try to passwordless all the tings and stick with the accounts, warts and all.

Instead of gutting health care to ~balance the budget~ deliver tax cuts to the rich, maybe they should make the [ultra rich contribute proportionally instead](https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2025/06/a-minimum-tax-on-billionaires.html)?
