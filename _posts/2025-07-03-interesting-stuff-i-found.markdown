### Azure Icons
Deep down in a Onenote note I found an old link to a [third-party maintained collection of Azure icons](https://github.com/benc-uk/icon-collection) (for presentations and documentation) 

That has not been updated in a while, but it turns out there is now an official Microsoft collection of Azure icons.
