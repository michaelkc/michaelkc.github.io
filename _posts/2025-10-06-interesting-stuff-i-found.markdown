### DHH on why he does not have 15 minutes for a "quick call"
Not a fan of video content, but I know this sentiment exactly. A 15 minute meeting at 13:00 can ruin an entire day of deep work.
It goes back to the difference between [makers schedule and managers schedule](https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) - meetings cost makers more.
Funny enough, I reflected on my experience today, and 2 x 5 minute interruptions in person in the office was significantly less disuptive than a
chat message "do you have 15 minutes for a quick call". Food for thought.
