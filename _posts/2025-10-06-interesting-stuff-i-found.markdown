### DHH on why he does not have 15 minutes for a "quick call"
Not a fan of video content, but I know this sentiment exactly. A 15 minute meeting at 13:00 can ruin an entire day of deep work.
It goes back to the difference between [makers schedule and managers schedule](https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) - meetings cost makers more.
Funny enough, I reflected on my experience today, and 2 x 5 minute interruptions in person in the office was significantly less disuptive than a
chat message "do you have 15 minutes for a quick call". Food for thought.

### The Architect Elevator
Participated in the [workshop](https://architectelevator.com/workshops/), great stuff. Gregor has seen it all, and can challenge your thinking like few others. I come away energized and with lots of food for thought, 
in the areas of political capital and how to spend it, ways to expand the solution space and how to be high level with depth - to name but a few.
I had a blast, colleagues were not quite as enthusiastic though (too many anecdotes for their taste), so YMMV. If you are a fan of the books, definitely go.

### Azure Dev Summit
Microsoft returned to Europe with a developer conference, and it was a great one. Portugal is lovely (first time there), and there was loads of great content. Standout sessions were 

- [Filip W](https://www.strathweb.com/)'s session on patterns for Small Language Models (and fine tuning them)
- [Safia Abdalla](https://blog.safia.rocks/)'s mini-workshop on re-implementing ASP.NET Core Minimal API (the framework) from scratch (2 hours!)
- [Bart De Smet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bartdesmet/)'s session on implementing a C# feature in the Roslyn compiler (1 hour!)

and a great workshop (with demo of [Sustineo](https://github.com/sethjuarez/sustineo)) about the new (LLM) Agents framework and LLM agents in general by [Seth Juarez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethjuarez/)

### GH-500 ESI Training
Triple-up on training, I did the [GH-500](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/gh-500) workshop virtually with a Microsoft trainer today. 
Strange pacing in the material, some of it very basic, some of the stuff around CodeQL very deep and difficult to grasp in a few overloaded slides, but the trainer did his best to make it work.
And I walked away with a better idea of how MS virtual training works.

The labs were somewhat broken (e.g. "do not introduce the synthetic bug in main but make a branch and a PR" ... "fix the bug you introduced in main"), but I found it interesting that they were automated with GitHub Actions, that analyzed your progress and updated the lab instructions based on this.

I previously did the MS Learn test exam for GH-500, and it seems way too easy compared to something like AZ-204. Not sure if this reflects the actual exam, but maybe I should give it a shot...
