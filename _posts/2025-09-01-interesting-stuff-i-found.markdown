### Refactoring Stubborn, Legacy Codebases
Stripe rediscovers that strong typing is great, unfortunately their code base is in Ruby so they have to write a type checker themselves :P

I do like the approach of gradual rollout though, and the architectural-constraints-as-code approach is something I also use on complex projects 
(usually [NetArchTest](https://github.com/BenMorris/NetArchTest/) but I am not sure it is maintained anymore?)
