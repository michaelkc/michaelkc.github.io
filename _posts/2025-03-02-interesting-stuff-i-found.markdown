### Monkeytype
I write on blank Das Keyboards, but my touch typing is a self-taught 6Â½-finger system, so I am not a fast typist.

I get by ([programming is not limited by typing speed](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/09/17/typing-is-not-a-programming-bottleneck/#b82afa298f114b8c89113ea5f40fc278) anyway), 
but I was looking for something to teach my son the basics.

[Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) seems to hit the marks

- support Danish words and keyboard
- some gamification
- free
