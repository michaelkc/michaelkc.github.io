### Monkeytype
I write on blank Das Keyboards, but my touch typing is a self-taught 6Â½-finger system, so I am not a fast typist.

I get by ([programming is not limited by typing speed](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/09/17/typing-is-not-a-programming-bottleneck/#b82afa298f114b8c89113ea5f40fc278) anyway), 
but I was looking for something to teach my son the basics.

[Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) seems to hit the marks

- support Danish words and keyboard
- some gamification
- free

### Lettuce out-of-order
Repro of the bug causing headlines for Nordnet, when it caused mixup of users sessions. I have participated in troubleshooting similar bugs before with similar impact (on a smaller scale though; not financial data).

### uv, an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.
Maybe this will emerge at the top to replace all the half-baked Python dependency/tool solutions?

Install with
```
winget install astral-sh.uv
uv python install
cd demo-project
uv init .
uv run main.py
uv add art
```
and run `main.py` as 
```
from art import *

def main():
    print("Hello from demo-project!")
    art_1=art("coffee")
    print(art_1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Micro-bit and Coding Pirates
I had a lot of fun helping one of my sons build a small car with [micro-bit](https://www.dr.dk/skole/ultrabit) and [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) (hardware and intro courtesy of [Coding Pirates](https://codingpirates.dk/)). 
Hats off to the volunteers that makes it possible.

### fDeploy, the "dogma" Octopus Deploy alternative
[fDeploy](https://www.fdeploy.com/) finally reached a public release. It will be interesting to see the price point and how well it works in practice. 
There is definitely a "small Windows shop" hole in the market that Octopus Deploy proper is leaving behind with their new pricing...

### CRUD apps are good business
