### OpenCodex
Someone forked [OpenAI codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) and made it able to run on any model, including local `ollama`. Pretty cool, although with the lack of sandboxing abilities, I am not going to run it on work code at this point. But I think I will give it a go  for some of my at-home hobby stuff.

### Conference - SecAppDev
There is little security training out there which specifically targets application security. I previously enjoyed [Hack yourself first](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/hack-yourself-first) and judging from the [presentations from previous years](https://secappdev.org/previous/), this looks like a great way to refresh and get in on the latest developments. The scheduling sucks though, do they not know that [Europe is closed for vacation during the summer](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2092429-twitter-x)? ðŸ˜‹

### Conference - Troopers
I have looked at Troopers for a few years, but I think much of the content is too pentester+ focused for my taste. Not going this year, but will keep looking.

### lazygit
Like Dive for containers, a wonderful TUI for Git. Makes it easy to clean up those pesky left-behind branches post-merge.
