### OpenCodex
Someone forked [OpenAI codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) and made it able to run on any model, including local `ollama`. Pretty cool, although with the lack of sandboxing abilities, I am not going to run it on work code at this point. But I think I will give it a go  for some of my at-home hobby stuff.

### Conference - SecAppDev
There is little security training out there which specifically targets application security. I previously enjoyed [Hack yourself first](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/hack-yourself-first) and judging from the [presentations from previous years](https://secappdev.org/previous/), this looks like a great way to refresh and get in on the latest developments. The scheduling sucks though, do they not know that [Europe is closed for vacation during the summer](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2092429-twitter-x)? ðŸ˜‹

### Conference - Troopers
I have looked at Troopers for a few years, but I think much of the content is too pentester+ focused for my taste. Not going this year, but will keep looking.

### lazygit
Like Dive for containers, a wonderful TUI for Git. Makes it easy to clean up those pesky left-behind branches post-merge.

### Vibe coding 12.000 lines of code per day
[Vibe coding 12.000 lines of code each day sound absolutely insane](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/realgenekim_vibe-coding-workshop-for-leaders-september-activity-7325638022572429314-HP7m) ([archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20250509070022/https://itrevolution.com/articles/vibe-coding-workshop-for-leaders/)) and I have a hard time believing that is actually useful, maintainable code. But I guess Gene Kim has some credibility from his DORA work?

Maybe they are taking a page out of Erik Meijers ["embrace the chaos"](https://x.com/headinthebox/status/1918030539958972507), and just letting the AI brute force things with no abstractions, given that no human is ever going to look at it? I have not seen that work well yet though, but maybe they have?
