### OpenCodex
Someone forked [OpenAI codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) and made it able to run on any model, including local `ollama`. Pretty cool, although with the lack of sandboxing abilities, I am not going to run it on work code at this point. But I think I will give it a go  for some of my at-home hobby stuff.
