### FastEndpoints
I have been looking into ways to organize ASP.NET Minimal APIs, FastEndpoints offer another approach. Seems to suffer from the "one primary contributor" issue of most open-source .NET projects, which leaves you with high risk when adopting it.

### Design Token-Based UI Architecture 
I mostly work in the backend, but I find this article on how to manage design abstractions and changes across technologies fascinating.

### Mapping the Mind of a Large Language Model
Really interesting look into how the internals of a LLM work. While they are sometimes derided as "next token predictors" (which they are), maybe so are we in a sense, given that the internal state is continually evolving with input. 
That being said, I [do not think we are on the verge of AGI](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Meta-s-head-of-AI-Yann-LeCun-does-not-believe-in-the-future-of-generative-AI-10276181.html), that seems like hype cycle hyperbole (remember Blockchain?) from people who like to pocket billions on [vague promises](https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/03/06/ilya-sutskever-ex-openai-gets-2b-funding-not-to-release-anything-until-he-has-super-intelligence/).

### Le Chat
European LLM chatbot alternative, haven't used it much yet but nice to see European tech companies in the mix

###  The AI Engineer Roadmap
Not sure that I buy that "AI engineer" is fundamentally different from tradtional software engineering (not mentioning "Vibe coding"), but there are some interesting ideas on how to handle the inherent non-deterministic nature of LLMs, when embedding them as part of a software solution. Also I like the razor focus on being a LLM _user_, which is what most developers are going to be.
